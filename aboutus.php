					<h1>Greetings From Freestone Road</h1>
					<p>Freestone Road Inc. is a Seattle-based consulting shop committed to helping small to mid-size companies squeeze maximum value out of the web - without spending a fortune to do so. We believe that the web is an incredibly powerful business development tool - whether you're acquiring new customers, selling direct, supporting off-line retail channels, or simply spreading the word about your brand. But the internet can also be a huge financial drain and distraction if you dive in without a solid plan and the right skills to grow efficiently. I created Freestone Road in order to help companies finding their own best path - by providing seasoned, independent advice, and a true passion for web-enabled business development.</p>

						<h2>What We Do</h2>
						<p>Here at Freestone Road, we build smart plans and help our clients execute them. We are strategists - working with clients to evaluate opportunities, interpret results, prioritize programs, and create efficient, achievable growth plans. We are also seasoned executors who love driving into the details, getting key programs started, training in-house staff, and leading tactical projects to meet specific goals and timelines.</p>
						<h2>How We Operate</h2>
						<p>Over the past 3 year, I've kept Freestone Road small and focused by design. I still assume hands-on responsibiltiy for every engagement we take on, and I still work with a small, hand-picked group of subject matter experts to keep quality high and costs manageable. Freestone Road accepts a limited number of engagements each year, and we never work with more than 3 clients at once. Why? Because we believe in the power of staying focused, delivering quality work, and providing each and every client with exceptional customer service.</p>
						<h2>How to Learn More</h2>
						<p>If you think Freestone Road may be able to help your business grow, I invite you to e-mail or call me directly any time. I'm always happy to discuss new business opportunities and ideas for growth. Let's see if Freestone Road is a good next step!</p>
